If all embeddings of one group were very close to each other, the WSS would be very small. In our case we see that the WSS for the black females is much smaller than for the white females. This means that it is much harder for the model to distinguish two black females than to distinguish two white females. The WSS complements the observation from the distance matrix, where we observed overall smaller pairwise distances between black females."
