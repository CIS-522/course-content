        "In this tutorial, we will study our first \"deep\" reinforcement learning algorithm: Deep Q-learning. Deep Q-learning is a natural extension of classic Q-learning, which we saw in the last tutorial. Recall that classic Q-learning is a \"tabular\" method. That is, we keep a table of Q-values for all state and action pairs. What happens if the state space is extremely large or continuous? Well, if the state is represented by a 64x64 image, then the Q table will have $256^{64 * 64} * \\text{num_actions}$ entries. This is definitely intractable.\n",
        "\n",
        "So what do we do? Here's where deep learning comes in to play! We can use a neural network to approximate the Q values. Let's call this neural net Q network. The Q network maps a state and action pair to its Q value. In practice, it takes in a state as input and outputs a vector of Q-values for all actions. We can then create the Q target by taking the max or derive a policy by taking the argmax. Mathematically, let $Q_{\\phi}$ be a Q network parametrized by $\\phi$. Given a transition tuple, the Q network minimizes the following objective: \n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, we minimize the squared error between the Q estimate and the Q target constructed from the Bellman equation. Convince yourself that an optimal Q network would attain zero loss on all transition tuples. We train the Q network using stochastic gradient descent: \n",

[MinAtar](https://github.com/kenjyoung/MinAtar) is a reduced implemention of five games from the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The state of each game is provided as a 10x10xN array, where N is number of relevant game objects. For instance, in the game Breakout, there are four objects - the paddle, where the ball is now, where the ball was last frame, and the remaining blocks. Thus the state for the Breakout environment will have the shape 10x10x4. Each game object only occupies a single element in the cell, as can be seen by running the code below."

This could be mitigated by introducing a target network. Target network is a copy of the Q-network that we update slowly to provide some stability for training. Formally, the Q network loss becomes $$\\ell(\\phi, B) = \\frac{1}{|B|}\\sum_{(s, a, r, s') \\in B}\\left(Q_{\\phi}(s, a) - \\left(r + \\gamma \\max_{a'}Q_{\\phi_{\\text{targ}}}(s', a')\\right)\\right)^2$$\n",

This was introduced later in the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) paper to improve training stability, and is the approach we use here.\n",

        "So far, we've seen a few successes of DQN on the MinAtar environment. Can we use DQN to solve all RL problems? Unfortunately, one glaring assumption of DQN is discrete actions. When computing the Q target or deriving the greedy policy, we need to take the argmax of Q-values over actions. If the action space is continuous, then searching for the argmax is a nontrivial optimization problem. Since we need to perform this search in each step of training and inference, the computation time becomes intractable.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) extends DQN to continuous actions by introducing an actor network. The goal of the actor network is to predict the action that maximizes the Q-value given the current state. This effectively amortizes the argmax search into training. Concretely, let $\\mu_{\\theta}$ be an actor network paramterized by $\\theta$. The actor's objective is to output an action that maximizes its Q-value: $$\\max_{\\theta} E_{s \\sim D}\\left[Q_{\\phi}(s, \\mu_{\\theta}(s))\\right]$$ and the Q network's loss becomes $$L(\\phi, D) = E_{(s, a, r, s') \\sim D}\\left[\\left(Q_\\phi(s, a) - (r + \\gamma Q(s', \\mu_{\\theta}(s'))\\right)^2\\right] $$ where we have replaced $\\max_{a'}Q(s', a')$ with $Q(s', \\mu_\\theta(s'))$. During training, we optimize the actor network and the Q network jointly using gradient descent.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may have noticed that the actor network looks like a policy. Indeed, DDPG is belongs to a family of RL algorithms called actor-critic algorithms. An actor-critic algorithm typically consists of a policy and a value function that are jointly optimized. The value function guides policy learning, and inference is done with the policy alone. We will discuss policy optimization and actor-critic algorithms in greater detail next week. \n"
