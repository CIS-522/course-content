    "\n",
    "Last week, we discussed natural language processing and the state of the art circa the early 2010s. In this tutorial, we will discuss the attention mechanism and how it can be used to improve the performance of a neural network, and we will implement attention and Transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we discussed an encoder-decoder architecture based on two RNNs for sequence to sequence learning. Specifically, the RNN encoder transforms a variable-length sequence into a fixed-shape context variable, then the RNN decoder generates the output (target) sequence token by token based on the generated tokens and the context variable. However, even though not all the input (source) tokens are useful for decoding a certain token, the same context variable that encodes the entire input sequence is still used at each decoding step. It is challenging for the models to deal with long sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [Bahdanau et al., 2014], the authors proposed a technique called attention. When predicting a token, if not all the input tokens are relevant, the model aligns (or attends) only to parts of the input sequence that are relevant to the current prediction. \n",

    "To calculate the attention mechanism we make use of Queries, Keys and Values. These tensors are each a transformation of the input vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "In an attention mechanism the context vector is computed as a weighted sum of values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed through an attention score. The score is usually the dot product between the query and key. The scores then go through the softmax function to yield a set of weights whose sum equals 1 â€” in other words, the weights are normalized so that every target token is assigned a \"how much does this token matter\" value for each output token.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query is from the decoder hidden state whereas the key and value are from the encoder hidden state. \n",

    " - the query Q (an embedding of the target word)\n",

    " - the values V (a function of K... you can think of these as the database lookup values that correspond to K)\n",

    "To give a concrete example, let's imagine a simple, single-sentence document. When I look at a sentence and see a word $q$, I want to know which word $k$ in the document is most relevant to understand what $q$ means. In other words, given a \"database\" of key-value pairs, I want to find the [set of] keys that best match my query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by constructing a query vector space $Q = $X \\dot W_Q^T$ where $X$ is the input sequence (i.e., our starting sentence that has been tokenized and embedded) and $W_Q$ is a matrix of weights that we'll learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll think of each word in the sentence as keys that we can use to \"look up\" the answer to our query; mathematically, we'll do the same as the above for the keys $K = X \\dot W_K^T$, and the value tensor $V = X \\dot W_V^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each pair of words $(q, k)$, we'll compute a score $s(q, k)$ that tells us how relevant $k$ is to $q$. We'll do this by taking the dot product of the query and key vectors, $Q \\cdot K^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can compute the final output of our attention head; $A = softmax(s(Q, K)) \\cdot V$. This is the weighted sum of the values, where the weights are the attention scores.\n",
    "\n",

    "We don't know ahead of time what $Q$, $K$, $V$ should be; we'll learn the weights from the data via backpropagation.\n",

And this base model architecture has been the foundation of many very successful models, some of which you may be using right now to write your answers to this notebook, and others of which you might be asking to make you reservations at a restaurant tonight. It has seen tremendous use in the NLP space, and there have been effforts to extend it to the audio and visual domains as well. The original paper that explained the Transformer architecture had the rather aggressive title, \"Attention is all you need\" â€” but so far, it has proven to be more correct than many expected! \n",

Both the encoder and decoder components are composed of stacks of submodules that use **only** attention mechanisms and linear weights to learn (there are no CNNs or RNNs). The architecture schematic looks like the following:\n",

    "* Sequences of tokens? We not only know what that looks like â€” we've written our own tokenizers!\n",
    "* Attention is the trickiest piece, but we've implemented it from scratch above. Nothing scary here!\n",

    "In the rest of this section we will be going over the various building blocks that go into Transformers.
