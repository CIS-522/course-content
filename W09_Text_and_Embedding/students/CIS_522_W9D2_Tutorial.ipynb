    "> * In general, Jupyter notebooks should follow good code-style practices, and all the imports should go at the top. But because much of this code might be useful to you in the future, we will leave cells with imports in them throughout the notebook so that it is easy to copy and paste to reuse this code. For more information on notebook best practices, see [here](https://gist.github.com/j6k4m8/864fb5a8a2257237169a48b6bd6a307e).\n"

    "In the previous notebook, we discussed a few ways to represent words as vectors: We generated one-hot encodings of words in a vocabulary, and saw that it lacked the ability to cluster similar words. We then generated context-free embeddings, and saw that they clustered words together but could not distinguish different meanings of the same word (for example, homonyms or alternate uses). Today, we will complete our triptych of embedding techniques, and continue our march toward large language models and transformers by discussing one of the critical developments of the modern NLP stack: **Tokenization.**\n",

The answer is that while our encoder was responsible for embedding words into a high-dimensional space, our tokenizer is NOT; the \"win\" of a tokenizer is that it breaks up a string into in-vocab elements. For certain workflows, the very next step might be adding an embedder onto the end of the tokenizer. (As we'll soon see, this is exactly the strategy employed by modern Transformer models.) \n",

In other words, the RNN gets the new input, and it also learns to interpret its own output from the previous window:\n",

Your humble author envisions this akin to mixing colors of paint: Each time you run the next set of inputs through the RNN, you mix one gallon of the new color with one gallon of the old (combined) color. After only a few iterations, the starting color of the paint no longer matters because it's been diluted so much by new inputs. Likewise, after only a few iterations, the previous sequence elements no longer matter because they've been diluted by the new elements.\n",

Many solutions have been attempted to fix this forgetfulness problem, but the most popular one is the _long short-term memory_ (LSTM) network. LSTMs are a special kind of RNN that have a special kind of memory cell that can be \"activated\" or \"deactivated\" at will. This allows the network to selectively remember or forget information as it sees fit. But even LSTMs suffer from vanishing gradients, though they can usually hold out a little longer and remember information for a few more iterations.\n",

Take note of how we generate text, recursively calling the same model with progressive inputs. Don't worry if you don't understand all the code; ultimately we will throw it all away this weekend and start with a new model on Monday — the model class that has revolutionized modern deep learning and changed the world.\n",
